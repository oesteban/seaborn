v0.6.1 (Unreleased)
-------------------

- Added an additional rule when determining category order in categorical plots. Now, when numeric variables are used in a categorical role, the default behavior is to sort the unique levels of the variable (i.e they will be in proper numerical order). This can still be overriden by the appropriate ``{*_}order`` parameter, and variables with a ``category`` dtype will still follow the category order even if the levels are strictly numerical.

- Improve performance for large dendrograms in :func:`clustermap`.

- Added ``font.size`` to the plotting context definition so that the default output from ``plt.text`` will be scaled appropriately. 

- Fixed a bug in :func:`clustermap` when ``fastcluster`` is not installed.

- Fixed a bug in the zscore calculation in :func:`clustermap`.
